I'm a former busines owner and CTO with a degree in Mathematical Sciences.

I have 5 years experience in building systems on Amazon Web Services, System 
Adminsnitration, Software and web development, and creating instructional and training
materials for technical content.

I have genereated over $1 Million dollars in sales using Amazon Web Services
Simple Email Service for my company and clients. I have also been invited to speak
on stage at various industry events on the use of existing and new 
techonologies.

I have a passion for learning new techonologies, training and teaching others, 
and solving problems.

Although I love being a business owner, I feel it's time for me to focus on 
educating myself, mastering the core cloud techonoliges that have made me
successfully.
